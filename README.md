# Project 1: InstaMET

For this Project 1, I have created an app that resembles Instagram, but instead of seeing posts from your friends, you will see "posts" from famous artists throughout history. We don't always have access to the MET Museum of Art (especially if you live on the West Coast like I do), but now you can enter through your computer screen!

## Basic Functionality Overview
- View an artist's name in the username
- View an artist's work in an Instagram-style post
- View the artist's profile picture
- View the post's comments, likes
- "Like" a post
- Leave a comment
- Go to the wiki page for an artist
- View the artist's caption, which includes the title of the work, the artist's short bio, and a random funny caption (out of 20 possible captions)
